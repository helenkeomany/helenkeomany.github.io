Things in your life are always changing. Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. Either way, you're always going to have to roll with the punches. 

For a long time, I focused on socializing as a hobby without even realizing what I was doing. I'd spent so much time with people in general that I never had much time for myself to dive deeply into hobbies and interests (unless it was an activity I had to do with other people). Last Fall 2017, I found myself with more free time than I'd had in years. I thought,"Who knows how long this will last? I should make the most of it."

In September 2017, I'd decided to learn how to partner dance, play piano, and join a book club. All in the same month. I'd never danced prior to last fall, and I hadn't played a musical instrument for 16 years. I couldn't even remember the last time I read a book from start to finish. Starting these hobbies put me outside of my comfort zone. I'd forgotten what it was like to be a beginner at something. 

I decided to apply for Flatiron School in March 2018 to start in June 2018. I knew it would be difficult and that even if I wound up struggling, I'd still learn something from it. I'm only two weeks in, but I've already learned so much from my brief exposure to Ruby. Although I'm slightly intimidated by it, I'm already looking forward to what's next.
